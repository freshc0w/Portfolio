                <p>Are you tired of wasting your precious time typing out long repetitive lines of HTML/CSS code? Or
                    rather dread the feeling of carpal tunnel set in after hours of coding? Well, look no further, for
                    Emmet is here to save the day (and your hands).</p>
                <p>As requested by some peers, I will be making a quick guide on the basics of Emmet and how it can
                    improve your workflow tremendously.</p>
                <p>Let's get straight into it.</p>
                <p>You might not already know it yet, but you might be already using emmet! In the first practical, you
                    might remember a short hand of initialising a html template using !.</p>
                <img src="./images/1blog-1.png" alt="Blog one picture one">
                <p>Pressing Enter should generate the following text:</p>
                <img src="./images/1blog-2.png" alt="Blog one picture two">
                <p>To create element tags, simply write the tags without the brackets.</p>
                <img src="./images/1blog-3.png" alt="Blog one picture three">
                <p>As seen, some common attributes for certain tags have been already initialised for you. Simply press
                    the Tab key to edit them instantly after creating the emmet expression.</p>
                <p>Classes and ids can be added with a "." or "#" respectively, after the element tags.</p>
                <img src="./images/1blog-4.png" alt="Blog one picture four">
                <p>You can also mix and match classes and id together. For div containers, the tag name is not required.
                </p>
                <img src="./images/1blog-5.png" alt="Blog one picture five">
                <p>Add multiple classes.</p>
                <img src="./images/1blog-6.png" alt="Blog one picture six">
                <p>Add custom attributes with square brackets []:</p>
                <img src="./images/1blog-7.png" alt="Blog one picture seven">
                <p>Reminder: After making the emmet expression and pressing Enter, press Tab to quickly edit the details
                    and text content of the element tag.</p>
                <p>Make nested elements with > (parent > child).</p>
                <img src="./images/1blog-8.png" alt="Blog one picture eight">
                <p>Add neighbouring elements with +.</p>
                <img src="./images/1blog-9.png" alt="Blog one picture nine">
                <p>Note: Neighbouring elements are not the same as nested elems. If confused, I recommend you to review
                    Nell's lecture on html.</p>
                <p>Create multiple copies with *. </p>
                <img src="./images/1blog-10.png" alt="Blog one picture ten">
                <p>The sky's the limit for creating expressions and this is where Emmet especially shines.</p>
                <img src="./images/1blog-11.png" alt="Blog one picture eleven">
                <p>You can also add text content to these elements directly from the expressions using {}. For lists,
                    you can use $ to number them correspondingly. So for our previous example:</p>
                <img src="./images/1blog-12.png" alt="Blog one picture twelve">
                <p>Whew. Imagine writing these out manually.</p>
                <p>Personally, I code with emmet in short successive bursts rather than a long one-liner (like the one
                    above), but I find it really useful for the layering and identifier-naming shenanigans in my code.
                    It also prevents potential opening and closing bracket bugs in your HTML code.</p>
                <p>If you're using a commonly recognised attribute, you can also use :.</p>
                <img src="./images/1blog-12.png" alt="Blog one picture thirteen">
                <p>So far, I've been only displaying the powers of Emmet in HTML but you can also use emmet expressions
                    in CSS. But because this guide is getting too long, here's a quick example: </p>
                <img src="./images/1blog-13.png" alt="Blog one picture twelve">
                <p>I encourage you to get used to Emmet as it allows you to not worry as much of the HTML/CSS syntax,
                    but rather the logic and implementation in the design of your website. </p>
                <p>With Emmet, you'll be spitting out HTML and CSS faster than a caffeinated squirrel on a keyboard.</p>
                <p>So far, I've covered what I do 80% of the time with emmet but this barely scratches the surface of
                    what Emmet has to offer. But if you want to learn more:</p>
                <p>These are the docs for, what I think, the most useful keyboard shortcuts with Emmet: </p>
